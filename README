 -h, --help:
    show help

 -s [TASK], --start [TASK]:

 -c [TASK], --clear [TASK]
	clear entries for task
 -l [TASK], --list [TASK]

 TASK: The task to track time on 

 == Examples

 rtime -s 

	Starts a new task with no name. 
 
 rtime -s bob

	Starts a new task called "bob"
 
 rtime -s 

	Stops a task with no name. 
 
 rtime -s bob

	Stops task called "bob"

 rtime -l %
	
	Shows all tasks.
 
 rtime -l bob-%
	
	Shows all tasks starting with "bob-"; you can use this as a hierachy, if you'd like,
	by name tasks clientname-project, or clientname-project-task. You can, of course,
	use any naming scheme and separator you might like. Both -l and -c take MySQL like
	wildcards, which is why % works.

	This command also displays a total. Eventually, date ranges and other options are a
	good idea. (Patches on this or any other front are welcome.)

 rtime -c %

	Clears all tasks.
 
 rtime -c bob-%

	Clears all tasks starting with "bob-".
